## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* Try to apply everything you have learned so far about data analysis (in creative ways if you can) such as data cleaning, data manipulation, data visualization, and various statistical analysis methods.

* Apply the iterative data analysis process -- setting expectations, collecting information, and reacting to data / revising expectations.

* Conduct your analysis in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and other Python libraries you have learned, as necessary.

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your Github repo for this project.

* **A Jupyter Notebook (statistical-analysis.ipynb)** containing your Python codes, outputs, and data visualizations. Make sure to include explanations for each of your steps in Markdown cells or Python comments.

* [optional] A `README.md` file containing any additional information.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

1. Explore data and understand what the fields mean.

1. Examine the relationships between the sales price and other features in the dataset. Use data visualization techniques to help you gain intuitive understanding of the relationships.

1. Make informed guess on which features should be investigated in depth.

1. Data cleaning & manipulation. Apply the following techniques as appropriate:
    * Adjust skewed data distribution.
    * Remove columns with high proportion of missing values.
    * Remove records with missing values.
    * Feature reduction.
    * Convert categorical data to numerical.

1. Compute field relationship scores with the chosen statistical model.

1. Present your findings in statistical summary and/or data visualizations.
